Section 1 - First meeting

after going to White Tiger Alchemy Shop while Loyalty of Sheng is 0:
	say "     Pushing the door to the store open you hear a little ding from the bell and take a look around. You're not exactly sure what you'd expect an alchemy store to look like to be honest. What this place [italic type]does[roman type] look like is a medicine shop at first glance, what with all the jars of herbs and liquids. But that gets shot out of your mind rather quickly when you see the practical impossibilities in glass containers on the shelves. For example, there's one jar that appears to contain a vortex of fire in it. As you however move to get closer to it, you hear a deriding, although you don't know how it's possible, cough from your right.";
	say "     Turning to the source of the sound you spot a rather fancy dressed white tiger. With the dark green vest, button-up shirt, leather skirt, and ankle-length coat you're pretty damn sure that he wouldn't be out of place of a fantasy novel. 'Are you going to buy something?' The tiger asks in a deep, almost purring voice that has a slight bit of annoyance to it. Figuring you'd best answer his question you ask him what he sells, which prompts him to raies his eyebrow, giving you the idea he thinks you're stupid for asking the returning question. 'This is an alchemy shop...' he drawls out, cementing that previous thought of yours. You tentatively put out the suggested answer that he sells potions.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     '[if Player is neuter or player is herm]Good job peon[else if Player is male]Good boy[else if Player is female]Good girl[end if], looks like you know the basics,' he says in a condescending tone though you can tell there [italic type]is[roman type] a little bit of praise in his words, causing you to feel embarrassed. 'But I feel like I should throw you a bone and offer you more information.' The tiger says this part with a chuckle as if it's an inside joke to him, causing you to stare at him oddly. He moves out from behind the counter and leans against the front of it.  'Currently I sell transformative alchemy potions. Before you hurt your small brain trying to contemplate what exactly that means, they are basically concoctions that change you into one of the many... creatures that you see wandering the city outside Atlantis,' he says, sneering when speaking about the various beings created by the nanites.";
	say "     You comment on that, asking if he's not one of those creatures, causing him to look at you in complete horror. 'No! Absolutely not, I am what you might call a mythical being, I am [italic type]natural[roman type] unlike them,' he says with a look of contempt. With a wince you ask him if he thinks that then why make potions that turn people into them then. That causes his face to soften before he speaks. 'I find the creatures themselves and how they came to be, the nanites that is, unnatural. The person themself I care nothing for and I can talk perfectly fine to, if not be a bit wary of their motives, as your kind is a randy bunch.' The tiger says with a raised brow. You let out a chuckle and admit that's true considering the people you've ran into. 'Anyways, finishing this conversation off, as I do have work to do, if you would like to purchase something, my name is Sheng and I'm one of the Four Lords of Atlantis,' the white furred male says before returning behind the counter, leaving you in the store.";

to say WhiteTiger:
	say "     As you look around you observe that the shop clearly has some old Asiatic influences from the building's inner and outer design in architecture and decoration. You're pretty sure it wouldn't look out of place on a street about three hundred or so years ago in China. At first glance you'd think it'd be easy to tell what kind of store it is, as lining the shelves are jars upon jars of various herbs and liquids, which makes you think medicine shop. However, upon noticing the glass containers containing minerals, metals, and woods as well as jugs of water. On top of that you would be able to spot various see through balls that contained swirling vortexes of fire. Thankfully though it was Sheng, the owner, who explained this place was an alchemy shop. Moving your gaze to the back of the shop you manage to spot the white tiger who raises an imperious look at you, as if expecting you to buy something or leave.";

to say ShengDesc:
	say "     Glancing over at the tiger you see the male is currently standing at the counter, hunched over a bunch of papers, possibly alchemical formulae. Ignoring that for now you look him over and take in his clothing. What the male is wearing is something you definitely wouldn't see outside of a fantasy book. First and foremost the tiger is wearing a dark green vest over a white button up shirt that's accompanied by a sea-green bowtie. Trailing your eyes downward you notice that instead of pants he's wearing a leather skirt that's held up by a belt made of similar material. Topping the outfit off, is a large lighter green than his vest coat that goes all the way down to his ankles, embossened with tigers dancing all over the edges. [if Loyalty of Sheng > 1]Having been staring at the male for a while it's not unbelievable that he's noticed you looking. He sends you a superior smirk that makes you twitch a bit.[else]Having been staring at him for a while it's not unbelievable that he's noticed you looking.

'[if Player is neuter or player is herm]Peon[else if Player is male]Boy[else if Player is female]Girl[end if], that's a topic that I'd rather not talk about,' he says, rolling his eyes. Nevertheless you push the topic causing him to let out a groan of annoyance before sighing. 'If you aren't aware, I am part of a council of advisors for King Poseidon known as the Four Lords.' Sheng says with a look of superiority. Nodding along, you ask the white tiger to continue. 'Our group consists of me, Sheng the White Tiger, Lord of West Atlantis, Serafino the Vermillion Phoenix, Lord of South Atlantis, Astor the Azure Dragon, Lord of East Atlantis, and Kuo the Black Tortoise, Lord of North Atlantis,' the white tiger explains in detail.";
	say "     Curious, you ask what he means by Lord of West Atlantis, which causes Sheng to smirk, and hold up a paw to stare at it. 'Well, as we are advisors for King Poseidon, this means we are also the voices for the people in our region. I for example speak for the people in the West,' the white tiger says as he acts as if he's polishing his claws. Deciding to move onto a different question before pointing out that his attitude might not be conducive to helping commoners you ask him if the others run stores as well. 'Well, I know that hyperactive bundle of feathers Serafino runs a spa, Astor spends way too much time at his restaurant but it helps him connect with his people, and that irritating Kuo teaches people at his dojo.' Sheng says, each mention of his fellow lords, showing what he thinks of them. However, by now you think you should change the topic as the tiger seems frustrated with it.";

to say ShengTalk2:
	say "     Mentioning his arrogant, holier-than-thou attitude, the tiger looks at you funny. 'You act as if I'm not above the lot of you.' Sheng says with a deep pur that rumbles through your bones. '[if Player is herm or player is neuter]Peon, [else if Player is male]Boy, [else if Player is female]Girl, [end if]I am [italic type]thousands[roman type] of years old. I know far more many things than you do and ever will,' he says with a look that clearly says he believes otherwise. Realizing that currently this topic isn't going to get you anywhere without him being pissed, perhaps you'll ask about it again when he trusts you more?";

to say ShengTalk3:
	say "     'I'm going to hope you're smart enough to be talking about the ingredients other than what you see in the shop, yes?' The white tiger asks, gesturing to everything here. You tentatively nod though you do make a comment that even with all the proof of items in front of you, you have no clue what goes to what potion. 'There is that, but I do have the right to protect my recipe don't I?' He says with a deep chuckle. You begrudge him that but you ask him if there's anything he could tell you. 'Oh, are you curious, [if Player is herm or player is neuter]eh peon[else if Player is male]eh boy[else if Player is female]eh girl[end if]? Even for a little bit of information?' He purrs deeply[if Loyalty of Sheng is 2], sending shivers through your body[end if].";
	say "     'Well, if you must know, one of the key ingredients in the transformative potions is... semen,' the white tiger says, barking a laugh when your face changes into an expression of shock at that. Wait, he uses cum in the items he sells? 'You honestly didn't expect it to be possible to change people into those... creatures without some of the original base material, did you?' He asks you increduously. Honestly, to be fair, with how much Sheng thinks of himself, yes you did, but if you say that bit out loud he'd probably react badly, so you just sasy yes. Your answer appears to appease the tiger, who smiles and waves it off.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'No, I may be good, but not that good. Alchemy requires give and take to get results, sure I could make a potion with ingredients that represented the traits of the creature, but you wouldn't get the same results,' he hums before drumming his fingers on the counter. 'But nevertheless, I've given you an inkling and that should be good for you, no?' The white tiger asks you in a tone that books no other answer than yes. Nevertheless you do say that was good enough information for now, resulting in him nodding and giving you a haughty look. 'Despite the enjoyable conversation that was I need to get back to work, afterall I am the only one who works here.' Sheng says, returning to his papers, jotting down a few notes, obviously on alchemical research, leaving you to stand in the store.";

to say ShengTalk4:
	say "     Mentioning that the only things you've seen on his list of potions for sale were transformative potions, you ask if he sells anything else. That causes him to quirk an expression of dispassionate interest towards you. 'Nothing that you'd be able to access at the moment for sure.' Sheng says in a somewhat kurt tone. That statement confirming that he [italic type]does[roman type] have other types of potions you ask why not. 'Because, for one I don't know you that well. Secondly, I don't sell those potions to people who do not have my interest, and [bold type]you[roman type] do not hold my interest at the moment [if Player is herm or player is neuter]peon[else if Player is male]boy[else if Player is female]girl[end if],' the tiger says with a deriding tone. You realize you aren't going to get anywhere with this topic until you somehow either get respect from the tiger or catch his interest and you feel the second one is far more likely with his attitude.";

While your tongue is busy your hands try to reach for your own crotch, however a hand grips your head tightly as soon as you try. 'No my pet, your first priority is me, not yourself.' Master says with a firm tone, booking no argument. Properly chastised you redirect one of your hands to his cock and start jerking him, making your owner grunt.

Right after that he quickly rids you of any clothes, if any and smirks at you. [if Player is herm]Reaching down with both hands your master lightly grips your already hard shaft and starts to stroke you slowly. Moving his other free paw to your pussy he slips a finger in and starts moving it in and out as he runs his hand over your cock. With a groan you can feel yourself close and it's not long before your body spasms and you feel your dick spill its load followed by your pussy leaking copious amounts of femcum. [else if Player is male]Reaching down with one of his hands he grasps ahold of your already hard shaft and begins to stroke it at a slow and tortuous pace. Whimpering you know by now not to beg him to move faster or to even hump the hand but it's so difficult. So instead you toy with your lip as he smirks down at you and teases you with his grip, going at a speed that's enough to keep you at the edge. However, when he suddenly quickens his strokes you let out a yelp as you start shooting your seed all over yourself. [else if Player is female]Your master reaches down with one of his paws and slips a finger into your pussy and starts to finger you at a rather slow pace. Your gasps seem to bring a smirk to his face despite the fact that this is supposed to be a reward for you. Biting at your lip, you hold yourself back from thrusting back on the finger as you know it'd probably get you scolded. Thankfully though the white tiger quickly speeds up his actions with his digit which causes you to moan loudly as femcum starts leaking from your pussy, your body writhing from pleasure. [else if Player is neuter]He appears to notice that you don't have anything visibly noticeable to play with but that doesn't deter him. Rather he holds a finger up for you to suck on, which you promptly do. After a few seconds, he pulls it out and positions it at your tight hole. Swirling it around the rosebud he waits a bit before pushing in and feeling around, as if searching for something. Suddenly you gasp and writhe in pleasure when his finger brushes up against something, that you're pretty sure is your prostate. Your gasps and moans cause your master to smirk at you and press at the bundle of nerves again, causing you to react again.

He says, trailing off and going to a shelf of various colored potions before grabbing one. The white tiger promptly uncorks the bottle and pours some of it onto his paws before he starts running them all over your body. Your eyes flutter close in a sense of soothing relief as your master takes care of you with a massage.

Realizing that he's being serious about allowing you to talk, you ask what's with the massage? 'That? It's simple pet. In something like what we did, aftercare is important,' the tiger says with a soft voice, something that really seems out of place for him.

Still putting on his clothes, you ask him why he treats his them better than others, despite still seeing himself superior to the pet. 'Oh? Well isn't it obvious? I own them, so taking care of them is a must,' he says firmly.

after going to Atlantis City Park while Loyalty of Sheng is 3:
	say "     Wandering around the city you soon come upon the park. At first it looks like there's nobody you recognize here but you soon spot somebody familiar. Sitting in the portion of the park with mixed herbs and flowers is Sheng, when you notice him you instantly wander over which causes the white tiger to look up with a raised brow. The male is currently harvesting some of the plants, possibly for some of his potions. 'Lay right here pet while I do my chores,' he orders, before turning back to the patch of herbs. Obliging your... master, you make your place and lay next to him on your back so that you're looking up at him.";
	say "     You see him smile at you before petting you with the back of his paw, probably so as to not get dirt on you, as his paws are pretty messy from harvesting the plants. 'This is pretty nice, isn't it my pet? Allowing others to see my ownership of you?' He asks you with a slight smirk. His tone sends a rumble of happiness through you, causing you to smile and nod a bit at him, before nuzzling his hand. 'Such a good [if Player is herm or player is neuter]pet[else if Player is male]boy[else if Player is female]girl[end if].' Your master says returning his attention to his task at hand. As he does it, he repeatedly rubs the top of your head.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The entire process of your master harvesting the herbs and flowers while petting your head goes rather fast, which doesn't surprise you. Especially since you kinda drift in and out of conscience. However when he's done, he taps you on the head, waking you up fully. 'You were pleasant to spend time with my pet, I would definitely enjoy talking about taking this relationship to the next level if you wish at a later date,' he says with a soft tone. You look at him with a curious look, wondering what he means. He shakes his head at you and smiles. 'We'll discuss it when I have time, for now I must go.' He says before getting up and heading off, leaving you to get up stand in the park.";
	now Loyalty of Sheng is 4;

Sheng ends here.
